  <h1>Why Linux?</h1>
  <p>Linux is a free and open-source operating system, meant to be an alternative to Windows.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Linux is Fast</h2>
  <p>Windows 11 comes installed with loads of extra bloatware, requiring more resources to run the base system. By
    default, Windows 11 uses around 3-6 GB of RAM idling. Linux, on the other hand, typically uses far less resources to
    run the base system. Ubuntu (a distro I would consider particularly bloaty) idles at around 1.5-2 GB of RAM. Because
    of the system's smaller footprint, you are able to dedicate more of your RAM to other things like videogames and
    productivity-- leading to a smoother and more enjoyable user experience.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Linux is Free</h2>
  <p>If you've ever built a PC, you would know that Windows 11 costs quite a bit. As of 2026, Windows 11 Home costs
    around $139.00 and Windows 11 Pro costs $199.99. On the other hand, Linux is completely free-- making it a more
    budget-friendly option. Of course, there are ways to get Windows for free, but should you really have to do that?
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Linux is Yours</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite things about Linux is that it's completely yours to do whatever you want with. Linux has a ton
    of different desktop environments, each with their own ecosystem of themes and customization. Linux allows you to
    make your OS truly your own. Take a look around r/Unixporn on reddit and see how other people have customized their
    operating systems!</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Linux is Secure</h2>
  <p>At the moment, Linux isn't nearly as popular as Windows. As such, most malware and spyware gets written for
    Windows. Just being on Linux protects you from a large majority of malware on the internet!</p>
  <br>
  <h2>So how do I get started?</h2>
  <p>Getting started is easy! The hardest part for most people is picking a distro. Luckily, I made a <a
